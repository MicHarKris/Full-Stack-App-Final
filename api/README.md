# Rest-API
 A REST API using Express. This API will provide a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses.

# About the Project
 I have attempted a solution using hooks, in order to store a hashed version of the password, after the length check is performed - Previously I saw behaviour where I could either test the length of the password correctly, or I could hash the password (after which, the length check would always be compared to the hashed, and radically longer password). This seems to solve the issue.
